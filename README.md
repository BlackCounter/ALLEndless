# Amazon Lambda Alternative

<div id="top"></div>
<!--
*** Architecture ALLEndless.
*** What is "AllEndless" Mod:
*** Changed Victory Conditions - For Shogun 2 - ALL "Domination" Campaigns! (Sengoku Jidai, RotS and FotS)
*** As long as no future patch adds new factions or changes the victory conditions for Shogun 2 
*** it wont need updating.
*** Lambda is easy to use and manage; the execution environment has a specific runtime on a known environment and you can just send code to it and it runs. Nice! *** This has served us well over the years. The biggest problem with that status quo, however, is when you want to achieve a use case outside these predetermined *** environments. Perhaps you want to perform some form of processing using a library that is not included by default into the lambda environment? Or even use 
*** your own runtime that is not provided?
*** ALLEndless tried to help solve some of these issues with the introduction of Lambda layers which was useful but still quite limited. 
*** Lambda by default is great for pick up and run with little to no maintenance, flexibility was sacrificed to achieve that simplicity.

<!-- ABOUT THE PROJECT -->
## About The Project

[![Product Name Screen Shot][product-screenshot]](https://ALLEndless.github.io)

change future of serverless by sentisize of lambda ,when you start coding new program in any languages they offer you lambda expersion for light
function do more things in short line code.
now we create new functionality to serverless , lambda in serverless is function as service by infrastructure such as retional databases like mysql or postgresql 
aws lambda using dynamodb for infrastructure ,we change in concept of lambda by adding programming language functionality lambda ,to serverless concept. 
you can up and launch this product in your could.

Here's why:
* Your cloud can more up/time
* Your code can be product without any coding language only text,tell our cloud, what you want in english.
* You can implement DRY principles to the rest of your life :smile:

Of course, no one template will serve all projects since your needs may be different. So I'll be adding more in the near future. You may also suggest changes by forking this repo and creating a pull request or opening an issue. Thanks to all the people have contributed to expanding this template!

Use the `BLANK_README.md` to get started.
